  <h3>CEREBRAL COASTERS.</h3>

  <p>In your <span class="keyword">cerebral cortex</span> right now, there are billions of <span class="keyword">neurons</span> working like crazy so you exist. And the neat thing about these neurons is how we've <span class="keyword">hijacked</span> a bunch of them into reading these words. Think of all the areas of your brain we are commandeering right now! <span class="keyword">Poop</span>. We just made you read the word poop. We might also have caused memories and images of <span class="keyword">poop</span> to plop through your brain. Whew, such power. To celebrate the power of our headiest of organs, we bring you these awesome Brain <span class="keyword">Specimen</span> Coasters.</p>

  <p>Each set of Brain <span class="keyword">Specimen</span> Coasters comes with ten glass coasters. Each coaster has four rubber feet (to further protect the surfaces the coasters are protecting in the first place) and a slice of brain printed on it. If you stack your Brain Specimen Coasters in the proper order (which is easy to do, since the coasters are labeled) and look from the proper angle, you'll see a full brain. Plus, if you use your Brain Specimen Coasters at your next science party, your friends will know how thoughtful you really are. Get it? Brain Specimen Coasters? Thoughtful? Uhhh.... <span class="keyword">poop</span>.</p>
